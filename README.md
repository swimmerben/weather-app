This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) because I didn't want to spend time configuring all the stuff that comes bundles with create react app



## A couple notes
I am using the [wunderground weather api](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) which has been great... but for whatever reason they didn't configure their autocomplete to allow cross domain requests so I had to set up the app to use a proxy-anywhere service that may or may not work... I don't own it.  Setting up my own proxy might be a good future enhancement

A [demo is available here](https://weather-a4395.firebaseapp.com/)
